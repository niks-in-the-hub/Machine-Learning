# Machine-Learning
My experiments in machine learning.

I am enamored by the universality of machine learning algorithms and how useful they could be in almost every business sector

1. Develop Python functions to compare different classifiers on Iris Dataset

2. Developing Machine Learning Applications in C# / .NET Core.

This is an awesome capability  to have given how seamlessly C# applications integrate seamlessly with other Azure services such as Azure functions(for serverless computing)
and stream Analytics services like Azure Event Hubs.

I look at performing data imports/Pre processing/Classification on the Iris dataset using C# and Visual Studio IDE
